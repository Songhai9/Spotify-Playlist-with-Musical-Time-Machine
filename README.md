## Creating a Spotify Playlist using the Musical Time Machine

In this project, the goal is to create a Spotify playlist based on the top 100 songs of a given year, thanks to
the https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100 webpage and Spotify for developpers.
We use the spotipy library to authenticate ourselves on Spotify and manage the playlist.
